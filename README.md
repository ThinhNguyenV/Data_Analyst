    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In the process of analyzing the data and building the sales revenue reporting model (<code>sale_amount</code>), we used LSTM models to capture cyclical instructions and patterns in the historical data (<code>order_date</code>). The model's results show the ability to accurately report false RMSE and MAE numbers on the trainer and training test only.</p>
    <p>This number indicates that the LSTM model has highly effective results in predicting future sales revenue. This means that businesses can use this model to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Business planning:</strong> By forecasting future sales revenue, businesses can increase resource planning and subsequent strategy more accurately.</strong> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inventory management:</strong> Accurate forecasting helps minimize excess or low inventory, optimizing warehouse management.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marketing strategy:</strong> Understanding sales trends helps businesses determine the best time to carry out marketing and promotional campaigns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The LSTM model has proven its ability to identify long-term and short-term sales trends, supporting managers in data-based decision work. By using historical data to predict the future, businesses can reduce risks and utilize their business more effectively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accuracy and reliability:</strong> The low index errors for the model were found to be highly accurate and reliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practical applied calculations:</strong>The model can be applied in real business problems for forecasting and planning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supports performance optimization:</strong> The LSTM model not only helps optimize inventory management but also supports businesses in planning business strategies within a deadline.
